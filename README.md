# global positioning system
- Developed by US military

- Car started using it in 1996

- Today GPS is managed by USA airforce

- GPS has three parts
![](assets/gps-three-parts.png)
- Ground station make sure satellite is on right position
![](assets/satellite-ground-station.png)
- Receivers sends signal to satellite 
![](assets/receivers-send-signal-to-satellite.png)
- GPS has 32 satellites 
![](assets/32-satellites.png)
- GPS has 10 years of lifecycles
- It needs regular repair
- It works for any weather
# How GPS works?
- It needs at least 4 satellites
- It is called `trilateration mechanism`
# 2-d trilateration

- Started walking from home for one hour
![](assets/2d-step-1.png)
- Ask farmer for clue
![](assets/2d-step-3.png)
- Ask police for second clue

- Ask a girl for third clue
![](assets/2d-step-6.png)
- Got your answer

- more satellite you used, more accurate position you get

# How distance are calculated
- Get distance based on speed of light
![](assets/gps-get-distance.png)
- Sync satellite atomic clock to receiver quartz clock
![](assets/receivers-sync-quartz-clock.png)
- Time moves faster for objects which is far away from gravity 
![](assets/gps-satellite-clock-ahead.png)
- If time problem is not solved than GPS location will be off by 6 miles every day
![](assets/gps-satellite-distance-off.png)
- time problem is solved by using four satellites
![](assets/gps-satellite-clock-delay-issue-solved-by-four.png)
- All ground station sends the updated satellite to all receivers
![](assets/gps-ground-statation-locate-satellite.png)
- Satellite also sends most accurate time, which is used by many system (banking, receiver etc)

- Sometime GPS is not accurate :-) 

# Alternate of GPS

# Military use
- US denied GPS access data to India in June 1999
- India developed it's own `navic` (NAVigation with Indian Constellation) GPS system, mostly for areas around India
    - First launch	1 July 2013
    - 12 April 2018
    - Total satellites 9
    - Cost US$315 million), to March 2017
    - Coverage
